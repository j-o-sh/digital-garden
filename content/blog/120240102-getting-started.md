# Getting started

So this is the <bww-random>420</bww-random>th attempt of launching a blog/personal website/digital garden I undertake. As always, life gets in the way and customer projects and going climbing is often more appealing than finally sitting down to create your own litle slice of web.

But here we go...

Social media today is **sick**. Every platform ever is completely marketing and advertising driven and as such tends to destroy the creative cradles it created when it was young in a cnabalistic attempt to generate even more churn and advertisement clickthrough.

With that in mind, the old advise becomes trueer every day: Build your own place and syndicate from there, only this way you know that it is actually driven by **you**.

I grew up with the advent of Myspace and am still a bit nostalgic about its passing. For all the technical shortcommings and eye-scorching designs, it had a diversity that was never reached again by the social media platforms that followed.


## On the technical side

Since this place is my own little playground, it is built in my thinking.

All code is (as far as possible) separated into _engine_ and _content_ (and I will make a post about that in teh future).

At time of writting I'll start with a simple [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) setup that is configured to read blog content in markdown from a content directory. Nothing more.
