# Getting started

So this is the <bww-random>420</bww-random>th attempt of launching a blog/personal website/digital garden I undertake. As always, life gets in the way and customer projects and going climbing is often more appealing than finally sitting down to create your own litle slice of web.

But here we go...

Social media today is **sick**. Every platform ever is completely marketing and advertising driven and as such tends to destroy the creative cradles it created when it was young in a cnabalistic attempt to generate even more churn and advertisement clickthrough.
