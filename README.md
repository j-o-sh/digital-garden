This repo contains the sources for the [bard with wings](https://bard-with-wings.netlify.app/) website.

It is, as it is a personal passion project, a playground for architecture and software ideas. It tends to rely on as little abstraction as possible and aims to be as domain driven and boiler-plate free as possible.
